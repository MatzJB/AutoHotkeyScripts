# AutoHotkeyScripts

My small collection of Autohotkey scripts.

winPocket

Winpocket is a small script for easy placement of a window into seven defined "pockets" of a screen. This script can be compared to the functionality in Windows where you can press win logo+right arrow, which moves and resizes the focused window to the right side of the screen.

This script enabled the user to place and resize the window into

* Quarter-screen resize
  * Lower left corner (Cltr-1)
  * Lower right corner (Ctrl-3)
  * Upper left corner (Ctrl-7)
  * Upper right corner (Ctrl-9)
  * Center of screen (Ctrl-5)
    (width and height is half of screen)

* Half-screen resizing
  * Left half of screen (Ctrl-4)
  * Right half of screen (Ctrl-6)
  * Top half of screen (Ctrl-8)
  * Bottom half of screen (Ctrl-2)
